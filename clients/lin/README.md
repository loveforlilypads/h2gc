The StatusCheck daemon does the following:

* Run hourly to run checks and update an overall status (checks update more descriptive problem statuses themselves)
* TBD - serve up a local copy of the GUI help system
* TBD - serve up a local copy of tutorial on coding status checks
* TBD - wizard mode to walk you through creating a status check

There should be a subdirectory for the graphical user interface, which has it's own readme.
