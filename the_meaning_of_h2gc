42.  No, wait.  That way nonsense lies.  Let us instead gaze into the navel of the philosophical underpinnings of this program.  Why is it here?  And, if that were ever known, would it disappear only to be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable?  And, has that already happened?   

Organizations depend on networks of complex computing systems operated mostly by humans.

It is almost impossible to stop a motivated person from bringing many of their own computing systems to the organization, increasing the overall complexity of the network, and decreasing overall understanding of the system.  This accellerating trend also increases the day-to-day efficiency and happiness of users.

Current research and common sense suggest that to minimize failures in a complex system, all members of an organization must be empowered to understand what a failure is, take charge of their own systems, and contribute to the overall performance of the system and therefore the organization. [1]

H2GC is designed to do help with that.

It is also kind of fun to write and gives a good overview of a lot of different platforms and technologies so even if I'm wrong about all that other stuff I'm gonna do it anyway.  When we all have implants you'll thank me!  Or us, if this ever becomes useful and other people decide to help out.  If it doesn't, well, then, you probably aren't reading this!  In any case, I fully expect we can work on this idea for as many years as humans are around.
