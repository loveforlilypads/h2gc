And, if that were ever known, would it disappear only to be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable?  And, how many times has that already happened?   

Organizations depend on networks of complex computing systems operated mostly by humans.

It is almost impossible to stop a motivated person from bringing their own computing systems to an organization, increasing the overall complexity of the network, and decreasing overall understanding of the system.  This accellerating trend increases the day-to-day efficiency and happiness of users. 

Current research and common sense suggest that to minimize failures in a complex system, all members of an organization must be empowered to understand what a failure is, take charge of their own systems, and contribute to the overall performance of the system. [1]

H2GC is designed to help people do that.

H2GC is also kind of fun to work on and gives a good overview of a lot of different platforms and technologies.  So even if I'm wrong about all that other stuff I'm going to keep working on it.  But I'm not wrong.  Prove it to me and I still won't believe it!

When we all have implants you'll thank me!  Or thank *us*, if this ever becomes useful and other people decide to help out.  If it doesn't, well, then, this document should fit right in with the manifestos, platforms, and philosophies of other computer programs, to be banned from the universe and retroactively deleted by the Pan-Galactic-Temporal-Time-Wasting-Committee, in which case you probably aren't really reading this right now, as it has been replaced by a long-winded admonition against philosophical statements, redundancy, and run-on sentences.

In any case, I fully expect that this idea can be worked on for as many years as humans are around, meaningfully or not.
