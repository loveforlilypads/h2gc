The HitchHikers Guide to your Computer (H2GC) is a client monitoring program that gives end users a fighting chance to learn and solve their own computer problems.

Any user of the H2GC can use the uber-simple client interface to learn about their computer, collaborate with others, and contact knowledgable people.

The server interface is simple and lightweight, and allows power users to identify problems with other systems quickly.

After installing on any supported client system, an icon will appear on the operatings system tray (or equivalent), informing users of the state of their system.  In the alpha relase, the two initial system issues checked will be fixed storage device health, and basic security issues.

It is extremely easy to enhance the system to check more system issues.  CreateTest.py to create a HelloWorld client system test, and then modify that, replacing the system check script with any script or program you like to check the issue you are concerned about.
