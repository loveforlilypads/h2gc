Lots more to H2GC if it's mobile:

----------
Peer-peer monitoring
----------

This could be a peer-peer monitoring system - everyone collaboratively gets reports on the health of the network.  You only get reports on other stuff if you are in groups.

This is especially fun because you can write it as anything that works to send http data via the api of the peer-peer network.  Getting disparate devices to participiate is an interesting thing.

I should write the client daemon and tests first as a monitoring package that reports on a single web page the status of the system, as well as the status of the network.

The script would run on mac/win/lin/android, and on a raspberry pi.

This script, installed on as many client systems as necessary, makes a nice client monitoring system.

It also, in combination with Rpis, makes it easy to keep persistent logs of wifi status, or switch ports and/or/and/or whatever they have sensors for.

----------
Various crowdsourced data maps
----------

Overlay group data on various crowdsourced network status maps out there.  Interesting to compare the status of the local net with that of larger nets.

----------
Group wifi alerting
----------

Everyones android phone runs H2GC.  It evaluates the status of the net and feeds that data back to the group.  They see it on a map, and an alert goes out to the group when issues arise.  

Android is perfect for this because when the wifi is down, you often still have cellular data, so alerts go through anyway.

----------
Peer-peer security
----------

This is hard, but if we can make phones spoof MACs and other identifying data, or not report it.

Phone MAC addresses are harvested: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/11/close-in_survei.html

----------
Peer-peer network healing
----------

If you are near a member of your group that doesn't have net access, you could automatically config as an Wifi AP for that person, bridging them onto 3G.

Phones in the future should be able to mesh with other phones to provide self-healing ability over wifi.

It might be possible to set up some phones as a WiFi repeater.  It is certainly possible to add a second wifi card to many devices (maybe not phones) and create a repeater or bridge.

Perhaps project byzantium would be interested in this.
