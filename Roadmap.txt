Grouped priorities into three sets.  Ambitiously these are monthly goal sets.

First Set:
============

Project has:
      Screen setup - DONE
      Basic makefiles where necessary - DONE
Linux Client GUI has:
      Plain english explanations of problems
      	    * read local file into menu - DONE
      Search link that works
            * open search engine with terms that match problem - DONE
      Collaboration System Link that works
            * open browser to relevant chatroom or group 
      Help System Link that works
      	    * ideally a local copy of an external wiki page, plus local log file and .teach files
Linux Client Daemon has:
      Two working trivial system checks that it can run - DONE
      Write out one-liner status and overall status to files - DONE
Server has:
      Rest server notifies ticket system immediately if comm status is 1.
      Crappy interface for looking at stuff - but most recent first!
Mac Client has:
      Existence
	    * use curl and a shell script if you have to, but make it notify something

Bonus Milestones:
=================

Ticket System has: (ticket system is just a test fixture)
      Existence
	    * Google Apps creates a ticket when an email is sent its way.
Monitoring System has: (monitoring system is just a test fixture)
      Existence
	    * Nagios can RCV an alert from a the H2GC server 

Second Set:
=============

Project has:
      Overall Makefile for install of all client and server components
      Fixture generator
      	      * fill client and server dbs with data - live server test gen
Server has:
      Cron job that checks rest server database every hour.  
      	      * If any user has no record in last few days, notify ticket system.
      Updated schema - checkin timestamps - map client key to userinfo table
      Homepage that can display user-view of data
Linux Client Daemon has:
      Wizard for checkscript creation
      Sends client key instead of test data
Mac Client has:
      Same GUI features as Linux client

Bonus Milestones:
=================

Windows Client has:
      Existence
           * background daemon first
      Basic GUI
      	   * same features as linux client GUI

Proof of principle!  Prototype on at least two platforms done!  

Third Set:
==========

Rewrite linux and mac client components TDD
Write tests for server
Package everything

Later:
======

Android and iOS clients
