This server should:

* Recieve status data from clients
* Provide a primitive view of the data to an admin
* Shuttle notifications to other systems as needed.

Started working from this example: http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/10/creating-a-rest-api-using-node-js-express-and-mongodb/

Not entirely sure that node/mongo are the right tools, but it's a fun experiment.
